        explanation: "Let $f(x)=x^3-6x^2+9x+k.$ Then $f'(x)=3(x-1)(x-3)$, so local max at $x=1$ and local min at $x=3.$ For three distinct real roots, the local max must be above the $x$-axis and the local min below it: $f(1)>0$ and $f(3)<0.$ Compute $f(1)=1-6+9+k=4+k$ and $f(3)=27-54+27+k=k.$ Thus $4+k>0$ and $k<0.$ So $-4 < k < 0.$"

        explanation: "The function $f(x) = x^3 - x$ is not one-one since it fails the horizontal line test: for example, $f(0) = f(1) = f(-1) = 0$. However, as $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) \\to \\infty$ and as $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to -\\infty$. By continuity, every real value is attained, so the function is onto.

This is of the form $v^2 = \\omega^2(A^2 - (x-x_0)^2)$, which corresponds to simple harmonic motion about $x_0 = -1$.
